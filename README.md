# NSD builder online docs

This is a documentation for the "Online Nassi-Shneiderman diagram builder" that can be found at [https://eurydia.github.io/project-nassi-shneiderman-diagram-builder-online/](https://eurydia.github.io/project-nassi-shneiderman-diagram-builder-online/).

I have decided to place the dcumentation in a separate repository because I want to separate the documentation from the code.
The documentation is written in Markdown and is converted to HTML using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), more specifically the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme.
