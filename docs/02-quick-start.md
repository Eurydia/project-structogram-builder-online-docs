# Quick start

## Getting started

To begin, head over to the live editor at [https://eurydia.github.io/project-structogram-builder-online/](https://eurydia.github.io/project-structogram-builder-online/).

## Interface overview

The editor presents two components:

- **Code Editor**: This is where the magic happens. A piece of code written here will be interpreted and transformed into a diagram.
- **Live Preview**: The resulting diagrams are displayed here in real-time.

## Hello World

For those using smaller screens like smartphones or tablets, the code editor might be hidden initially.
If you find it hidden, tap on the "SHOW CODE" button to reveal it.

In the code editor, type "Hello World!;."
The project should generate the corresponding diagram:

<iframe width="100%" style="aspect-ratio: 16/10; border:none;" loading="lazy" src="https://eurydia.github.io/project-structogram-builder-online/?preview=true&content=Hello+World%21%3B"></iframe>

## Export

Once you are satisfied with the diagram, you can use the export feature to save your diagram in three different file formats: PNG, JPEG, and SVG.

Moreover, sharing is made seamless with the ability to generate a unique link for your diagram.
